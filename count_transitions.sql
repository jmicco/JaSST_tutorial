# Finds all tests that are probably flaky, having more than 2
# transitions in a 1 month period.  NOTE: This may need to be tuned to
# match your particular situation or data.
#
# Simply sort the result by timestamp of the commit or something that
# tracks your branch, generate ROW_NUMBER(), and then join back against itself
# to find the transitions.
#
# This query simply sorts by the number of state changes of the target
# results.  Find a line that shows which tests are flaky,  this query
# excludes any target where there have not been at least 2 transitions.
#
# Only include results of PASSED, FAILED, FLAKY and SKIPPED.  In our system
# other results indicate problems running the tests or tests that we never ran

In order to participate in the hands-on potion of this class, you will
need a laptop with internet access and a Google account.  A github
account and/or a place to sync the github repository is optional.

Raw data from our paper from:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5_QHWCtac81VGNKYnhrQkJBZGM

I pre-loaded the data using swizzle.py into BigQuery for 10K and 100K
samples and the full data set.  We will be able to run some queries to
reproduce the results from our paper!  You could upload the data
yourself, but that will not be necessary today.

Google has agreed to pay for the BigQuery costs associated with this
lab, you will need to send me your Google account information at:
john.micco@gmail.com so that I can authorize your account to view and
query the data.

This repository contains the queries that we will be running

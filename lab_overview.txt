In order to participate in the hands-on potion of this class, you will
need a laptop with internet access and a Google account.  A github
account and/or a place to sync the github repository is optional.

Raw data from our paper from:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5_QHWCtac81VGNKYnhrQkJBZGM

I pre-loaded the data using swizzle.py into BigQuery for 10K and 100K
samples and the full data set.  We will be able to run some queries to
reproduce the results from our paper!  You could upload the data
yourself, but that will not be necessary today.

Google has agreed to pay for the BigQuery costs associated with this
lab, you will need to send me your Google account information at:
john.micco@gmail.com so that I can authorize your account to view and
query the data.

This repository contains the queries that we will be running:

https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/mystic-berm-192720:TestResultData.results

You will need to send your Google account ID to john.micco@gmail.com
for me to authorize you to use the BigQuery account for this lab.

You could reproduce these repositories using the swizzle.py program included
in this repository.  I produced 10K and 100K samples simply by using
head -10000 <datafile> > sample10k.csv
head -100000 <datafile> > sample100k.csv

All of the queries are in this github repository:

* count_points.sql - simply counts how many total P/F results are in
  the entire set

* count_results.sql - Counts the number of each type of result in the
  set

* count_transitions.sql - Counts the number of transitions for each
  target - high numbers of transitions / time period indicate tests
  that are flaky.  The results of this query are stored in the
  flaky_tests table.

* shared_history.sql - Shows the tests that transitioned at the same
  time during the month.  Tests sharing the history across the month
  likely are not flaky.  Depends on the target_transitions table

* target_transitions.sql - Finds all of the places where a transition
  occurred for all targets.  The results of this query were saved as
  the target_transitions table.

We will walk through running these queries and interpreting the
results in the lab.
